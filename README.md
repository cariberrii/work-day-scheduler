## Description

AS AN employee with a busy schedule <br>
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner <br>
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively

This planner utilizes bootstrap input groups to layout a daily schedule interface which displays the timeblocks between the hours of 8am-5pm (finishing at 6pm). Each timeblock is color-coded based on the past (grey), present (red), and future (green) when the timeblock is viewed. It allows the user to enter an event when they click a timeblock and write a maximum of two rows of text. This way, items on the to-do list will be viewed without having to scroll within the block for hidden and potentially overlooked tasks. The tasks entered by the user are stored in local storage when the save button is clicked for the corresponding timeblock and remain on the schedule when refreshed.
